# Jim Weller

I'm **@jim-weller**, a tech veteran with over 20 years of experience in software
and platform engineering, enterprise architecture, and leading teams across
industries like retail, finance, higher education, and software. I've done it
all in IT, from Helpdesk to Enterprise Architect. I've been an individual
contributor and people leader in every hat I've worn. I joke that I'm a plumber
because I identify more with backend, platform, and ops than with customer
facing or FED.

- 👀 **Currently into:** Platform engineering, Integrations Platforms, Public Cloud, Developer Platforms, Developer Experience (plumber stuff). AWS, K8s, Github. Tinkering with AI/ML delivery, including hands-on exploration with AWS Bedrock, LM Studio, Langchain, PandasAI, and Chainlit. Mostly I follow my muse here.
- 🌱 **Lifelong learner:** Whether it's building things in my workshop, outdoor adventures, or diving into new tech, I'm driven by that exhilarating tipping point where learning opens up new horizons.
- 💞️ **Looking to collaborate on:** Cutting-edge tech projects that blend innovation, meaningful solutions, and maybe a dash of humor.

- 🧔🏻‍♂️ **Pronouns:** He/Him.
- ⚡ **Fun fact:** I grew up off-grid on a homestead. And I lived in Alaska for 25 years.
